### Acknowledgments
Thank you to a mentor of mine Dr. Lawrence Gray who has supported me in both computer programming instruction and collaboratively debugging code as well as often with much needed checks and balances when my logic gets off track and an accountable and insightful listening ear. I'm sure I'll have more of you to thank for your feedback on the site as it progresses.

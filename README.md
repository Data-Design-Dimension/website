### Acknowledgments
Thank you to a mentor of mine <a href="https://lwgray.github.io/">Lawrence Gray, PhD</a> who supported me in the initial building stages of this website in 2021, in both computer programming instruction and collaboratively debugging code as well as often with much needed checks and balances when my logic got off track and an accountable and insightful listening ear.
